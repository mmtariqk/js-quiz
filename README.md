Quiz App:

This code quiz includes multiple choice questions on a landing page User Interface. There is a call-to-action button called Start Quiz. Once you clicked that button you will be able to see question with three possible choices A, B & C to choose an answer among them. Only one choice is correct and you will see a green indicator for correct answer. On the other hand, there is a red indicator for wrong answer. So, the candidates need to choose the correct answer for the question they are presented with. Besides, this code quiz is using two timers such as a running timer and a timer for each question thereby it's timed code quiz with countdown of time. Furthermore, there is only 12 seconds for each question to answer. If the students did not answer the question in twelve seconds, then the quiz will move to the next question automatically. Also, there is a time subtractions if you answered the questions in a couple of seconds, you will move to next question. After all, the technologies I used in this quiz are HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, and JAVASCRIPT. On top of that, the landing page is fully responsive for all screen devices viewports. In addition, this app stores the high score in the local storage. The local Storage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year. On top of that, by the end of the quiz you will be able put user initials for highest scores to submit that you obtained.
